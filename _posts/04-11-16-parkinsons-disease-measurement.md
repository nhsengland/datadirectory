This paper presents maps of the inferred relative prevalence of PD in England. The maps are based on data from publicly accessible data sets:

* one that contains for each of the 10,000 GP practices in England the number of NHS prescriptions written for each drug in June 2012;

* one that shows the post code of each practice;

*one that shows the eastings and northings of each post code.

The data does not explicitly mention PD, so we adopt a proxy measure. This is based on the observation that some drugs, such as levodopa, are associated with PD. The ratio between the number of Parkinson's prescriptions written by a practice and the total number of prescriptions that it writes gives an indication of the prevalence of PD in that practice's catchment areas. We go one stage further, we derive our proxy measure by dividing a practice's ratio by the national average ratio. This gives the inferred relative prevalence for that practice. It is from these values that the maps are drawn."
