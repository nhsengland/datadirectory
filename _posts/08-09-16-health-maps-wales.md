description: "Health Maps Wales is an interactive tool that can be used to explore a variety of health indicators grouped under broad categories, such as cancer, common procedures and causes of injury. The maps allow the user to explore data at their geographic area of choice (where available), to look at trends and to compare areas against a Wales comparison figure. Indicators are available at Middle Super Output Area (MSOA), Upper Super Output Area (USOA), Unitary Authority (UA) and Local Health Board (LHB) "
